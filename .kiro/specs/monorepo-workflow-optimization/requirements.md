# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines requirements for optimizing the development workflow in an Expo monorepo setup that supports both mobile (Expo/React Native with Tamagui) and web applications (MUI). The system aims to reduce cognitive load and maximize productivity for creating, testing, building, and deploying applications while maintaining code reuse through shared packages.

## Glossary

- **Monorepo_System**: The complete workspace containing multiple applications and shared packages
- **Development_Workflow**: The end-to-end process from code creation to deployment
- **Shared_Package**: Reusable code modules (@bdt/ui, @bdt/components, @bdt/network)
- **Mobile_App**: Expo-based React Native applications using Tamagui for UI
- **Web_App**: React web applications using Material-UI (MUI) for UI
- **Build_System**: The compilation and bundling process for applications
- **Test_System**: Automated testing infrastructure for packages and applications
- **Deploy_System**: The automated deployment pipeline for applications

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified development environment setup, so that I can quickly start working on any app or package without configuration overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer clones the repository, THE Monorepo_System SHALL provide a single command setup process
2. THE Monorepo_System SHALL automatically install all dependencies for apps and packages

3. THE Development_Workflow SHALL provide isolated testing environments for each Shared_Package
4. THE Development_Workflow SHALL generate TypeScript declarations automatically for all packages
5. THE Development_Workflow SHALL validate package exports and dependencies before publishing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want efficient application development tools, so that I can rapidly prototype and iterate on mobile and web applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting application development, THE Development_Workflow SHALL launch the appropriate development server based on target platform
2. THE Development_Workflow SHALL provide unified component development experience across Mobile_App and Web_App platforms
3. THE Development_Workflow SHALL automatically sync shared package changes to running applications
4. THE Development_Workflow SHALL provide platform-specific debugging tools and error reporting
5. THE Development_Workflow SHALL support simultaneous development of multiple applications

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing infrastructure, so that I can ensure code quality and prevent regressions across the monorepo.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Test_System SHALL provide unit testing capabilities for all Shared_Package modules
2. THE Test_System SHALL provide integration testing for application-package interactions
3. THE Test_System SHALL provide visual regression testing for UI components
4. WHEN code changes are made, THE Test_System SHALL run relevant tests automatically
5. THE Test_System SHALL generate coverage reports for packages and applications

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated build and deployment processes, so that I can efficiently release applications without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Build_System SHALL optimize builds for different platforms (iOS, Android, Web)
2. THE Build_System SHALL generate platform-specific bundles with appropriate optimizations
3. THE Deploy_System SHALL provide automated deployment to staging and production environments
4. THE Deploy_System SHALL perform pre-deployment validation and testing
5. THE Deploy_System SHALL support rollback capabilities for failed deployments

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent code generation and scaffolding tools, so that I can quickly create new applications and components following established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Monorepo_System SHALL provide templates for creating new Mobile_App instances
2. THE Monorepo_System SHALL provide templates for creating new Web_App instances
3. THE Monorepo_System SHALL generate boilerplate code for new Shared_Package modules
4. THE Monorepo_System SHALL automatically configure routing, navigation, and basic screens for new applications
5. THE Monorepo_System SHALL ensure generated code follows established architectural patterns

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unified tooling and scripts, so that I can perform common development tasks consistently across all projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Monorepo_System SHALL provide unified commands for starting, building, and testing any application
2. THE Monorepo_System SHALL provide dependency management tools that work across the entire workspace
3. THE Monorepo_System SHALL provide code quality tools (linting, formatting, type checking) with consistent configuration
4. THE Monorepo_System SHALL provide performance monitoring and bundle analysis tools
5. THE Monorepo_System SHALL provide documentation generation tools for packages and applications

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want cross-platform component compatibility, so that I can maximize code reuse between mobile and web applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Shared_Package SHALL provide platform-agnostic component interfaces
2. THE Shared_Package SHALL automatically render components using Tamagui for Mobile_App
3. THE Shared_Package SHALL automatically render components using MUI for Web_App
4. THE Shared_Package SHALL maintain consistent design tokens across platforms
5. THE Shared_Package SHALL provide platform-specific optimizations when necessary
